# Cribl Helm Charts

This is a Helm repository for charts published by Cribl, Inc.

We now have a really fast way to deploy an entire distributed Cribl Stream environment to a Kubernetes cluster, using the workergroup and leader Helm charts.

# Prerequisites

Helm version 3 is required to use these charts.

To install Helm on (e.g.) a Mac, using Homebrew:

```
brew install helm
```

Instructions for other operating systems can be found here: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

# Deploying

If you haven't done so already, create a namespace. Our documentation example uses `cribl-stream`.

```
kubectl create namespace cribl-stream
```

Add the Cribl Helm repo.

```
helm repo add cribl https://criblio.github.io/helm-charts/
```

The following example creates a distributed deployment with two auto-scaled worker groups:

- `pcilogs`
- `system-metrics`

In addition, the example:

- Uses an auth token of `ABCDEF01-1234-5678-ABCD-ABCDEF012345`
- Sets an admin password
- Installs our license

For Workers to communicate with the Leader node, both Worker Group deployments reference the Service (`ls-leader-internal`) created by deployment of the Leader Helm chart.

```shell
helm install ls-leader cribl/logstream-leader \
  --set "config.groups={pcilogs,system-metrics}" \
  --set config.token="ABCDEF01-1234-5678-ABCD-ABCDEF012345" \
  --set config.adminPassword="<admin password>" \
  --set config.license="<license key>" \
  -n cribl-stream

helm install ls-wg-pci cribl/logstream-workergroup \
  --set config.host="ls-leader-internal" \
  --set config.tag="pcilogs" \
  --set config.token="ABCDEF01-1234-5678-ABCD-ABCDEF012345" \
  -n cribl-stream

helm install ls-wg-system-metrics cribl/logstream-workergroup \
  --set config.host="ls-leader-internal" \
  --set config.tag="system-metrics" \
  --set config.token="ABCDEF01-1234-5678-ABCD-ABCDEF012345" \
  -n cribl-stream
```

## Running Distributed on a Free License

To run a distributed instance without specifying a license in your install, go into Cribl Stream's user interface and accept the Free license. The Free license allows only one Worker Group.

You can configure the Leader as Distributed, by specifying the `config.groups` option. If you don't specify it, the default configuration is Single Instance mode. You can later manually reconfigure it as Distributed via Cribl Stream's UI.

# Upgrading

Upgrading Cribl Stream to new bits is easy. Update the repo, and then upgrade each chart version. The example below updates to the current version, but you can append `--version X.Y.Z` if you want to [specify a particular version](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/).

```
helm repo update
helm upgrade ls-leader cribl/logstream-leader -n cribl-stream
helm upgrade ls-wg-pci cribl/logstream-workergroup -n cribl-stream
helm upgrade ls-wg-system-metrics cribl/logstream-workergroup -n cribl-stream
```

# Running unit tests

Unit tests are implemented using [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest/).

Using their docker image is the simplest way to run the tests. The pattern is

```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd):/apps" helmunittest/helm-unittest PATH_TO_CHART
```

Testing logstream-leader

```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd):/apps" helmunittest/helm-unittest helm-chart-sources/logstream-leader
```

Testing logstream-workergroup

```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd):/apps" helmunittest/helm-unittest helm-chart-sources/logstream-workergroup
```
